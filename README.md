A repository for my Spotify and Apple Music playlists for Marvel songs.

## What this repo covers
This repo contains my Spotify (and in the future Apple Music) playlists covering the scope of the **Multiverse Saga** of the MCU, including any Sony-Marvel movies and shows released during this period of time. The playlists exist as CSV files created using [Exportify](https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify), as well as direct hyperlinks on the aforementioned music streaming platforms. These include the following public playlists (including any future playlists):

## What this repo *doesn't* cover
This repo only contains **legal** streaming links to my playlists (on Spotify, and soon Apple Music and maybe even TIDAL). Under no circumstances do I provide any illegal/warez download links to any song, album, or otherwise other content owned by Marvel, Disney, or any third party or subsidiaries. If you try pirating any of this music, you do so at your own risk, and I do not condone this behaviour whatsoever.

## Why this repo
Sometimes rights to songs expire, but they might exist as parts of other albums. Sometimes I might forget to add the tracks from a movie or show, especially when the soundtrack album is released as multiple different EPs/albums. This repo is to keep track of those changes, and any additions, or otherwise removals (for example, for purposes of deduping) related to them. This is mostly for me to keep track of sh*t, but you are free to check this repo for updates on my playlists. Where possible, I will try and avoid spoilers in initial commits. However - and this is important - please see the next section.

## OBLIGATORY SPOILER WARNING!!
While I do not intend to willfully spoil any movies, shows, special presentations or other related Marvel content for you - and will indeed, endeavour to avoid any spoilers in initial commits made when a new piece of Marvel content drops (in cinemas or on Disney+, depending on release strategy/platform) - you hereby forfeit any and all right to whine about spoilers if you click on any of the hyperlinks above, whether that be by way of song titles, or otherwise. Tl;dr,

Finally, I had no part in creating Exportify (linked above), but the great work put together by the developer of that resource is greatly appreciated.
